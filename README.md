# Biosignal-Simulator
Medtech Merchants 3rd year project respiratory :)

In this repository, you will find **MATLAB code files** for **signal processing**, specifically:
- Digital Filtering to achieve desired Bandwidth
- Signal Gain
- Noise Generation
- Denoising Raw Data

There is a **header_file.m** which defines the value of the constants, and defines the functions.

The **main file** that calls the individual files' functions is **BioWave.m** . The header_file.m is also loaded in here, so that the rest of the code can access the constants and functions that we defined.
